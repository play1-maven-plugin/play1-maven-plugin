    <description>
Allow users to login to your Play! application via Shibboleth.
Shibboleth is a federated identity management protocol popular in
higher education. The protocol provides a single sign on service
across multiple organizational boundaries with secure attribute
delivery. Shibboleth support requires that your application be proxied
behind a Shibboleth capable web server such as Apache, Lighttpd, or
IIS with the corresponding Shibboleth module installed. For more
information on the protocol visit: http://shibboleth.internet2.edu/
